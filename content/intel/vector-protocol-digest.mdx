The digest documents the reconciliation pattern that let us ship commands over hostile networks. Instead of retries we used a quiescent vector clock and shipped mutations as compact deltas. The approach avoided burst storms when crews reconnected a field kit and prevented dozens of follow-on tickets.

I also outline the observability signatures that differentiate a real outage from a transient mismatch.
