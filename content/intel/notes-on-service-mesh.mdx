summary: Field-tested playbook for keeping multi-tenant service meshes trustworthy when the certificate authority lives on the wrong side of a slow link.

I embedded with two platform teams rolling out a mesh on air-gapped gear. The control plane loved to panic whenever a CA rotated mid-mission. This report documents the guard rails we implemented: split brain detection, workload identity linting, and deterministic retries that never amplify outages.

Key callouts:

- Re-signed workloads no longer require draining an entire node pool.
- Traffic assertions run inline so you can diff policy drift before rollout.
- Observability hooks publish every mTLS failure with enough context to replay the negotiation offline.
