summary: Unified six telemetry surfaces into a single dashboard that streams 11k events per second with deterministic playback controls.

Legacy consoles forced analysts to tab through separate programs during an incident which meant nobody had the full picture. I partnered with sensor engineers to normalize payloads and designed a typed event bus that feeds the dashboard via Server-Sent Events.

We project the fused signal into a WebGL scene. Each subsystem owns its own shader + legend so we can add new feeds without a rewrite. When bandwidth drops the renderer gracefully degrades into vector shapes, keeping 60 FPS on ruggedized tablets.

Analysts also needed to rewind incidents in slow motion. We carved out a Redis-backed history buffer that stores ten minutes of high-resolution state and replays it in sync with audio transcripts.
