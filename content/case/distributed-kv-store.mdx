summary: Built a verifiable command KV layer that replicates across data centers with sub-second recovery and human-friendly introspection.
---

The mission combined an aging command-and-control stack with a modern telemetry stream. We replaced the bespoke cache with a replicated KV mesh backed by Temporal so that every write records the workflow context and is replayable.

Key constraints included zero data loss, deterministic conflict resolution, and the ability to replay a failing workflow mid-flight without pausing other clients. I designed the state machine language, wrote the Rust sidecars that guard every write, and exported a typed SDK for product teams.

We layered observability by rendering the workflow graph as MDX-driven diagrams so command could literally trace a command hop-by-hop. Recovery drills now take minutes, not hours.
