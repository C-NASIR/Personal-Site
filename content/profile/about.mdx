## Mission Statement

I build the internal systems and developer platforms that keep launches, migrations, and security reviews calm. My bias is toward deterministic tooling, deterministic telemetry, and telling leadership exactly what will break if we do nothing.

## What I Build

- File-driven case management systems with cinematic but fast UIs
- High-signal dashboards that surface trade-offs instead of vanity metrics
- Developer platforms that make multi-region deployments feel like one region

## What I Care About

1. Clear trade-offs that leadership can repeat back to the board
2. Operational metrics paired with the human workflow they represent
3. Design systems that stay accessible even when the adrenaline spikes

## What I'm Aiming For Next

High trust product teams where the job is to launch surprisingly polished internal systems—platform, reliability, and intelligence tooling that unlocks revenue teams and operations alike.

## Working Style & Principles

> Minimal ceremony, maximal clarity. I prefer docs that explain the tradeoffs, not the technology buzzwords.

- Roadmaps tied to investigation logs so we remember why a decision happened
- Honest status updates and quick redaction of risky assumptions
- I escalate scary ambiguity immediately, not after the build fails

## Selected Highlights

- Led a multi-team modernization of an orbital commerce stack; cut orchestration time by 38%
- Designed the command palette and search index that now powers three internal products
- Ran operator lab days to validate telemetry overlays before shipping to the fleet
